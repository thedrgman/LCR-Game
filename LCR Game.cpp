//  LCR Game
//
//  This game is where a minimum of 3 players start with 3 chips each. Then on their turn they must roll the number of dice
//  equal to the number of chips they have, up to 3 dice. If they roll a 1 then they have to give 1 chip to the person to
//  their left. If they roll a 2 then they have to give 1 chip to the pot in the center. Then if they roll a 3 then they have
//  to give 1 chip to the person to their right. Lastly, if they roll a 4, 5, 6 then nothing is done. They must do this for
//  every dice they roll. Once someone is the only one with chips they won the game.
